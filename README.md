# Objects_and_Inheritance_Pointers

##Author: Tony Nguyen

To compile, run: make
<br />
To run the program: ./bear_sim_3000
<br />
To get rid of object files/compiled files, run: make clean
<br />

This program uses pointers to create objects and allow for inheritance in C.
As an example, the bear species are created based off of the inheritance of characteristics
of the bear class. From there, different bear species had different characteristics, such as
what they ate and their study habits, while tracking their happiness and health.
